As you can imagine, a Cambridge University student’s diary is very busy, filled with lectures, supervisions, practicals, reading, formal halls, sports practices, society meet-ups, and of course socialising! However, there are some important Cambridge traditions bookmarked in every student’s calendar.

<h2>MATRICULATION</h2>
To officially become a member of the University of Cambridge, all students have to be matriculated at their college. The ceremony involves signing the Matriculation Registration Form and takes places in Freshers’ Week, making it one of the first things students do when arriving in Cambridge to study. After the ceremony, students attend a delicious three-course dinner to celebrate with the rest of their year and academics from the college.

<h2>SPECIAL FORMAL HALLS</h2>
While most colleges host formal halls regularly, many also put on special formal dinners to mark different occasions. Some colleges offer these “super halls” with themed dishes to celebrate events such as Thanksgiving, Halloween (complete with fancy dress!), and Burns Night – and there are even extra special Harry Potter-themed dinners! Perhaps one of the highlights of Michaelmas term is each college’s Christmas formal hall. These highly sort-after formals are right at the end of the first Cambridge term and are a lovely opportunity for students to celebrate with friends before leaving for the Christmas holiday. Christmas songs, roast turkey, and mince pies fill the hall creating such a festive atmosphere – and some college staff even dress up in Santa costumes for the evening!

<h2>BRIDGEMAS</h2>
Since Michaelmas term typically finishes at the end of November/early December, Christmas at Cambridge University (nicknamed Bridgemas) takes place on 25th November, giving students the chance to celebrate and get into the festive spirit before the Christmas break. Most colleges host special Christmas formals and some hold other festive events, such as decorating the college Christmas tree. Students can arrange for a charity candy cane to be placed in their friend’s pigeon hole as a Christmas surprise, and Cambridge’s renowned club, Cindies (actually called Ballare), holds an end of term Christmas party featuring all of the classic Christmas songs.

<h2>COLLEGE FAMILY AND MARRIAGE</h2>
The collegiate system at Cambridge University provides a fantastic support network for students, which is further complemented by the college family system. When joining a college as a first year, students are allocated college parents – two students from the year above studying the same or similar subjects. In Freshers’ Week, students meet their college parents (and the extended college family sometimes!) and are given the opportunity to have “family time” to get to know one another. A student’s college parents are there to answer any questions they might have – whether that’s about college life, the course, or living in Cambridge. As a first year student, one of your tasks is to find a suitable college partner and get “engaged” (usually with a jelly sweet ring). Most colleges hold formals dedicated especially to these college marriages in either the first or second term, where first years can celebrate finding their college partner.

<h2>VARSITY RUGBY MATCHES</h2>
Shortly after the end of Michaelmas term, as per Cambridge tradition (and Oxford tradition…) Varsity Rugby Matches take place. Men and women from Oxford and Cambridge University compete for victory at Twickenham Stadium in London. Coaches ferry students from Cambridge on a crisp December morning to show their support with Cambridge blue scarfs, hats, and other merchandise while the players battle it out against the “other place”, as Oxford University is often referred to.
