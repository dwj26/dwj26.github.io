Studying the Natural Sciences course at the University of Cambridge is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. You are taught by some of the world’s leading scientists in surroundings where breakthrough discoveries have been made – not to mention that Cambridge is such a gorgeous city to live in! But studying the Natural Sciences course at Cambridge is not a walk in the park; it’s very fast-paced and involves a lot of hard work. Any NatSci student (Cambridge lingo for someone studying the Natural Sciences course) will tell you how they have spent many late nights frantically finishing essays or desperately trying to learn the enzymes in biological pathways. If you’re thinking of applying or just want an insight into life at Cambridge University, here is what a typical week for a first year biological Natural Sciences student looks like.

## MONDAY
**9 AM—10 AM MATHS LECTURE**<br>
If you picture yourself rolling out of bed late morning or early afternoon, think again, 9 am lectures (or even 8.45 am lectures!) are a regular occurrence for a Natural Sciences student.

**10 AM—11 AM BIOLOGY OF CELLS LECTURE**<br>
After starting the day learning how to model biological populations or using statistics to analyse data, you might find yourself learning about the functions of the cell membrane or the intricate details of respiration.

**11 AM—4 PM BIOLOGY OF CELLS PRACTICAL**<br>
Once lectures are over the rest of your day is usually spent in a practical; for example, you could be taught how to properly focus a microscope or perform one of the most fundamental research techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

**6 PM—7 PM DINNER AT COLLEGE**<br>
A short cycle back to college and before you know it, it will be time for dinner. Most students eat in hall as it’s a great opportunity to catch up with friends from other years or on different courses to chat about your day, share stories, and plan social activities.

**7 PM—8 PM BIOLOGY OF CELLS SUPERVISION**<br>
With first year students having a large amount of their time scheduled for practicals and lectures, supervisions are usually held in the evenings. Supervisions are typically spent reviewing key points from the week’s lectures, exploring ideas and theories further, and reviewing work set from the previous week. Having a small group teaching session with a leading academic from your college is one of the best parts of studying at Cambridge. Despite the pace of learning being very fast, supervisions are the perfect chance to make sure everyone is up to speed and to clarify any queries you might have.

**9 PM—10 PM SUPERVISION WORK**<br>
And a first year NatSci’s day doesn’t end there, most evenings will be dedicated to preparing supervision work – whether that’s researching and writing an essay, answering chemistry or maths questions, or creating a presentation.



## TUESDAY
**7 AM—9 AM ROWING**<br>
If you choose to try rowing during your first year, you’ll have some early morning training sessions to squeeze in before lectures – say hello to 6 am starts!

**10 AM—11 AM CHEMISTRY LECTURE**<br>
One of the great things about the Natural Sciences course at Cambridge is the flexibility it offers. You can choose from a variety of different subjects each year depending on how your interests change and evolve. As a first year biology student, you don’t have to take purely biological subjects but you can, for example, choose to study chemistry or material science as one of your options. Often students come to Cambridge with plans to specialise in one subject and find themselves actually specialising in a completely different field.

**11 AM—12 PM COFFEE BREAK**<br>
With Cambridge being home to many great independent coffee shops, you’ll be pleased to hear that a NatSci’s timetable does offer the chance to grab a cup of coffee. A delicious flat white with an almond croissant and a quick read through your notes, and it’ll be time to head off to your next lecture.

**12 PM—1 PM PHYSIOLOGY LECTURE**<br>
Held in one of the old wooden lecture theatres within the Physiology Department, you’ll find yourself learning about action potentials and how your kidneys function. Next stop lunch!

**2 PM—4 PM MATHS PRACTICAL**<br>
Yep you read that right, a maths practical – well more specifically, a practical teaching you how to use software such as Matlab and R. While really useful for a future career in research, these practicals can be quite amusing with students crashing their computers by getting them stuck in infinite loops or creating funny shaped graphs.

**5 PM—6 PM CHEMISTRY SUPERVISION**<br>
An hour discussing orbitals, transition states and curly arrows, chemistry supervisors help you understand what an earth these words mean!

**6 PM—9 PM DINNER AND WRITE UP LECTURE NOTES**<br>
It’s time to make sense of those messy notes you made from this morning’s lectures – better to do it now rather than trying to interpret what you meant when it comes to revision later in the year.

**9 PM—LATE PRE-DRINKS AND CINDIES**<br>
Tuesday nights out in Cindies will be on most students’ timetable. The nightclub Cindies (actually called Ballare) is renowned for its Big Fish Ents student nights where classic club hits, film theme tunes like Titanic, and Disney songs fill the club.



## WEDNESDAY
**9 AM—10 AM MATHS LECTURE**<br>
With lectures for each subject being held at the same time every other day, it’s quite easy to get to grips with where you should be and when – even after a night of partying in Cindies!

**10 AM—11 AM BIOLOGY OF CELLS LECTURE**<br><br>
**2 PM—3 PM MATHS SUPERVISION**<br><br>
**5 PM—6 PM ERG TEST**<br>
2K erg tests are a rower’s worse nightmare but they are an important part of training. Mastering these gruelling tests on little sleep or after a night out is all part of life as a Cambridge student.

**6 PM—7 PM DINNER AT COLLEGE**<br><br>
**7 PM—8 PM PHYSIOLOGY SUPERVISION**<br><br>
**8 PM—10 PM SUPERVISION WORK**<br>
Time to start tackling those tricky chemistry questions you’ve been set, which will probably involve a trip to a friend’s room as two minds are more likely to solve these than one!



## THURSDAY
**10 AM—11 AM CHEMISTRY LECTURE** <br>
After a busy evening of supervision work, it’s nice to have a slightly later start to catch up on a bit of sleep – very important when the Cambridge University eight-week terms are so jam-packed!

**11 AM—12 PM COFFEE AND READ THROUGH LECTURE NOTES**<br><br>
**12 PM—1 PM PHYSIOLOGY LECTURE**<br><br>
**2 PM—5 PM PHYSIOLOGY PRACTICAL**<br>
Perhaps some of the most exciting experiments you’ll get to perform while studying at Cambridge, physiology practicals might involve looking at your heart’s activity or getting your lab partner exercising to assess the effect on their breathing.

**7 PM—LATE FORMAL**<br>
Time to enjoy a yummy three-course meal at your friend’s college to celebrate their birthday before heading to Lola Lo to round off the evening.



## FRIDAY
**9 AM—10 AM MATHS LECTURE**<br><br>
**10 AM—11 AM BIOLOGY OF CELLS LECTURE**<br><br>
**11 PM—5 PM CHEMISTRY PRACTICAL**<br>
A six-hour practical? While chemistry practicals might sound really long, they include a lunch break and time to answers some questions on your experiment, all while your concoction is bubbling away.

**6 PM—7 PM DINNER AT COLLEGE**<br><br>
**7 PM—9 PM SUPERVISION WORK**<br>
A couple of hours spare to finish attempting those chemistry supervision questions before a fun evening out with friends.

**9 PM—LATE CLARE CELLARS**<br>
Clare Ents hosts Clare Cellars most Friday nights during term time, where bands and DJs come and perform in the cellars of Clare College. It’s a great chance to get together with friends from other colleges, enjoy a few drinks and relax after a busy week.



## SATURDAY
**10 AM—11 AM CHEMISTRY LECTURE** <br>
No, that’s not a typo, first year NatSci students do in fact have Saturday lectures! With terms being just eight weeks long, there is a lot to cover!

**11 AM—12 PM COFFEE AND READ THROUGH LECTURE NOTES** <br><br>
**12 PM—1 PM PHYSIOLOGY LECTURE**<br>
While spending Saturday mornings in lectures might not sound that appealing, most students can make it back in time for brunch – a highlight of every student’s week.

**1 PM BRUNCH AT COLLEGE**<br>
There are lots of fab places to go for brunch in the city but as a student, brunch in college is the best way to start the weekend and a great opportunity to invite friends over from other colleges.

**3 PM—5 PM ROWING**<br><br>
**5 PM—10 PM SUPERVISION WORK**<br>
With a clear evening ahead, now is the time to tackle that physiology essay.



## SUNDAY
**11 AM—12 PM COLLEGE CHOIR PRACTICE**<br>
If you want to try a new hobby while at university, the collegiate system at Cambridge provides the perfect opportunity for this. Most colleges have their own music societies and sports teams in addition to the university teams. College societies and sports teams are usually open to college members of all abilities with practices and rehearsals typically being much more relaxed than that of the university teams.

**1 PM—4 PM SUPERVISION WORK**<br>
Sunday afternoons are for those short answer questions set by your Biology of Cells supervisor. Time to hit the textbooks.

**4 PM—6 PM SUPERVISION WORK**<br>
Biology of Cells questions done, now time for your Maths supervision work.

**6 PM—7 PM DINNER AT COLLEGE**<br><br>
**10 AM—LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AT KUDA**<br>
As a Cambridge student, you don’t tend to venture out to the clubs on Friday or Saturday nights. However, Sunday night is a big student night in Cambridge, with many societies having nights out at the club Kuda.
