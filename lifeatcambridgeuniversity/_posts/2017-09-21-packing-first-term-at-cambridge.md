title: PACKING FOR YOUR FIRST TERM AT CAMBRIDGE
---
It’s hard to anticipate everything that you might need when packing for University, especially when you are just starting your first year. There are the essential things that most students need, such as crockery and bedlinen, but after being at University for a term or two, you’ll find there are other things you wish you’d thought to bring. To help you pack for your first term at Cambridge University, here are my top tips for what you should bring.



6 THINGS TO PACK FOR YOUR FIRST TERM AT CAMBRIDGE:

1. OUTFITS FOR FORMAL HALLS
As I blogged about before, attending formal dinners is a big (and really fun!) part of life at Cambridge University. You will find yourself invited to a fair number throughout your degree to celebrate college events, such as Matriculation and Halfway Hall, friends’ birthdays, or for socials. For most formal halls the dress code is smart so it’s a good idea to pack a few different outfits, such as nice dresses and evening skirts. Formals are a great excuse to dress up with friends so make sure you pack some cute accessories too!

2. UNDERGRADUATE GOWN
In every Cambridge University student’s suitcase is their undergraduate gown – a black robe that is worn when attending formal halls and also for the graduation ceremony. Don’t worry about buying a gown before you arrive in Cambridge as you can easily pick one up from the University outfitters in town, such as Ryder and Amies or Ede and Ravenscroft.

3. DIARY/CALENDAR
After arriving for your first term at Cambridge, you will find yourself quickly becoming busy with lectures, practicals, and supervision work. It’s best to bring an academic diary or calendar with you (or use an online calendar) to keep yourself organised and on top of everything – and to make sure you don’t forget the fun social activities, societies, or sports practices you want to attend! Buying a diary is also a great excuse to invest in some cute stationary. Some of my favourite diaries currently available include this fun Kate Spade one and this cute pink Collins diary.

4. BACKPACK/SATCHEL
Most students who cycle in Cambridge use a backpack to carry their laptop and notes to lectures. There are many stylish backpacks available, such as this Eastpak rucksack, these apricot and turquoise Herschel backpacks, or this Jack Wills one. If you fancy a more traditional look, the Cambridge Satchel Company offers beautiful satchels and batchels in a range of gorgeous colours, including special editions of their classic bags in Cambridge University blue or with Cambridge blue stripes.

5. EVENING DRESS FOR WINTER BALL
A few colleges host black-tie balls in Michaelmas or early Lent term including Fitzwilliam College (every other year), Selwyn College (every other year), and Churchill College (every year). If you can’t wait until the summer to experience your first Cambridge May ball (they are a truly incredible experience!), winter balls are a great chance to get a flavour of what these magical events involve. Evenings filled with artificial snow, twinkly lights, warm drinks, endless supplies of food and non-stop entertainment, winter balls are a fantastic way to celebrate the end of the first Cambridge term, or make a nice break from supervision work in Lent term. If you’d like to attend one of these winter balls, pack an evening dress (I’d recommend a floor-length dress as queuing to enter can be rather chilly!), a warm wrap, and accessories, such as a clutch bag and comfortable heels/flats (you’ll be on your feet for about 8-10 hours!).

6. SPORTS KIT FOR ROWING
Rowing is so “typically Cambridge” that you can’t come and study here without trying it at least once! As a novice rower in your first term at Cambridge, you won’t need any special kit – you’ll have the chance to buy “stash” from your college boat club during the term. Most freshers wear leggings, a sports top or T-shirt, and warm socks but make sure you bring some extra layers to wear to and from the boathouse as you’ll mostly be training in the early hours of the morning.

I hope my top tips help you pack for your first term at Cambridge University. If you enjoyed this blog, look out for advice on what to pack for Lent term coming soon!
