April usually means miserable showers but how lovely has the weather been this year? 27 degrees, blistering sunshine, and flip flops aren’t usually on the cards for Spring but, like me, I’m sure you haven’t been complaining! It’s amazing how much happier a bit of sunshine makes everyone - it definitely puts a smile on my face and a spring in my step. Here are some of the little things I’m loving in Cambridge this April, which I hope you are too!

### Cherry blossom and magnolia tree spotting
As if Cambridge isn’t stunning enough with its beautiful colleges, river, and quaint shops but when the cherry blossom and magnolia trees flower in Spring the city looks gorgeous. Whilst wandering around the city running errands and meeting up with friends, I’ve been loving spotting cute corners of Cambridge sprinkled with beautiful pink cherry blossom or scattered with magnolia flower petals (and photographing them too)! I know they’ll soon disappear and it will time for the wisteria to flower but I have to say, I think the beautiful pink shades of blossom and magnolia flowers are my favourite.

### Making the most of the light evenings
Now the clocks have sprung forward and we are on British Summer Time, I am really enjoying the lovely light evenings. It really makes a difference coming home after work to a light and airy house and makes me much more inspired to go out in the evening, rather than curl up and watch TV with a cup of tea. One of my favourite things to do is head into town for a scoop (or two) of delicious gelato from [Jack’s Gelato](https://www.jacksgelato.com/). This independent shop is run by gelato enthusiast,  Jack, and is open until 9.30pm–10.30pm each day. Jack serves up some truly irresistible flavours, including elderflower and damson sorbet, and the most to-die-for milk chocolate gelato. With a yummy ice cream in one hand, it’s blissful to walk around the city centre and soak up the picturesque views of the river while the sun sets.

### Buying fresh flowers from Cambridge market
This Spring, I’ve been buying beautiful fresh flowers from [Cambridge market](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/markets). While I used to mostly buy flowers from the supermarket, I have since discovered the flower stall on Cambridge market, which does the most exquisite flowers (including flowers you wouldn’t usually see in the shops) at the most reasonable prices. In addition to supporting a local business, there is something really satisfying about walking into town on a Spring morning and choosing some flowers from the market. The other weekend, I bought some gorgeous white hyacinths and gypsophila, which I arranged into five vases of different sizes to place around the house. While it’s just a little touch, the flowers are lovely to look at each time I walk past.

### Eating brunch outside
If you’ve followed me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/asliceofcambridge/?hl=en) for a while, you’ll know I’m a sucker for a spot of weekend brunch - and why wouldn’t you be when Cambridge has such a great choice of [healthy brunch locations](/healthy-brunch-spots-hot-numbers-coffee)! The sunny April Saturday mornings have been perfect for brunch outside and I recently enjoyed a scrummy eggs benedict on sourdough bread (the best) sat on [The Petersfield’s terrace](http://www.thepetersfield.co.uk/). Their little outside space features wooden tables and benches, with fairy lights and rugs for the chiller summer evenings. This little gem is in the heart of one of Cambridge’s most popular residential areas and is popular with locals but by being slightly off the beaten track, it’s a great place to meet friends for a more relaxed brunch setting. Where have you been enjoying brunch recently?
