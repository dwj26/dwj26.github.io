Easter is a lovely time of year to bake for friends and family. One of my favourite things to bake is Easter biscuits, iced with pretty pastel colours. If you are looking for some Easter baking ideas or just want to learn how to decorate biscuits, here are some recipe suggestions for making Easter biscuits, as well as some of my baking and decorating tips.

For the Easter biscuits themselves, I tend to use a basic shortbread recipe, such as this shortbread recipe from BBC Food, since I find shortbread biscuits not too sweet so they perfectly offset the sweetness of the royal icing I use for decoration.

After weighing out all the ingredients, I use my KitchenAid with the flat beater attachment to quickly mix everything together into a smooth ball. Shortbread mixtures are a little crumbly so if you are doing this part by hand, you‚Äôll need a bit of elbow grease to soften the butter and bring everything together. Next, I roll out the mixture until it is about 1 cm thick, making sure to regularly check that the dough hasn‚Äôt stuck to the surface! I found some great Easter cookie cutters in Lakeland and use these to cut out different biscuit shapes, before carefully transfering them using a palette knife to a lined baking tray. Following BBC Food‚Äôs recipe, I bake my biscuits for about 15 mins at 180¬∞C in a fan oven until they are light golden brown in colour.

Most of the beautiful iced biscuits you see in shops and cafes are decorated with royal icing, which is simply made from icing sugar, egg whites, and a drop of water following the recipe from Peggy Porschen‚Äôs Cookies book. The trick is to vary the consistency of the icing depending on whether you are outlining a biscuit or covering larger areas, known as ‚Äúflooding‚Äù. This part can be a bit tricky and definitely gets easier with practice! While some bakers make their own icing bags from baking paper and cut the end off to create an icing ‚Äúnozzle‚Äù, I personally find a ready-made piping bag easier to use and a metal icing tips typically gives me a more consistent and sharper edge. I use Wilton‚Äôs food colouring gels to colour my icing as they last for ages but just make sure to use a clean utensil each time you dip into a pot.

The KitchenAid Stand Mixer with the whisk attachment works like a dream to whip up some royal icing. When I am planning to make multiple colours, I usually make a big batch of white royal icing and then divide it into smaller bowls to add the colouring to (this just saves on washing up!) Food colouring gels are very concentrated so you need the smallest amounts to mix pastel colours. Another great little tip I have learnt from following bakers on Instagram, is using a cup to hold your piping bag while scooping in the icing, to avoid icing spilling out of the end everywhere! Now comes the fun part ‚Äì decorating!

If you‚Äôre decorating biscuits for the first time, my main advice is to not be too ambitious; it definitely takes practice, patience, and a very steady hand! Try mastering simple techniques first, like outlining a biscuit with royal icing and then flooding it to cover the surface completely, before tasking yourself with some of the amazing designs you see on Instagram. The great thing with royal icing is that it dries fairly quickly allowing you to add extra details on top of a layer, such as patterns and features. And voil√†, cute biscuits to enjoy with a pot of tea and a hot cross bun over the Easter weekend. Happy baking! üôÇ
