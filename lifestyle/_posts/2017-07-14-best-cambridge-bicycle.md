title: Best Cambridge Bicycle
---
If you’re coming to Cambridge to work or study, sooner or later you’ll find your new best friend not being a person or a pet but a bike. How else are you meant to make that 9 am lecture when it’s 8.55 am or beat the long traffic jams when trying to get to work? A bike is the mode of transport when in Cambridge. But if you aren’t used to getting around on one, the thought might seem a bit daunting. Here is some advice on the best Cambridge bicycle.

Best Cambridge Bicycle

<h2>THE VINTAGE-STYLE BIKE</h2>
You have probably seen pictures of King’s Parade with vintage-style bikes featured as quintessentially Cambridge – and this isn’t far wrong. Many companies now sell vintage-looking bikes in a range of pastel colours complete with a cute wicker basket on the front and a pannier rack at the back. The wicker basket can be used for holding a small bag, a handful of notes and books, or some shopping but adding panniers to the rack at the back will provide space for larger items. If you dream of living the Cambridge fairytale and cycling around the city with a bunch of fresh flowers resting in your basket, I’d definitely recommend buying a vintage-style bike.

<h2>THE HYBRID BIKE</h2>
If a vintage-looking bike is not your kind of style, there are plenty of hybrid bikes available with straight handlebars and without a basket. A hybrid bike is a great option for travelling short distances around a compact city like Cambridge and is ideal for someone who is not experienced at using a road bike. Hybrid bikes typically require less maintenance, which is important to consider if you aren’t a whizz at repairing punchers or replacing brake pads.

<h2>THE ROAD BIKE</h2>
If you have a long distance to commute and you know how to handle a road bike (including being able to successfully unclip your feet from the cleats at traffic lights so you don’t fall over sideways), this could be the option for you. The little friction from the tyres makes these bikes uber speedy – ideal if you have to get from one side of the city to the other, or if you become a rower and find yourself dashing to and from the boathouse at some early hour of the morning. Some people add pannier racks to their bikes but many opt for a backpack to carry their things, helping to make the bike even lighter. While these sorts of bikes can be really pricey, they also typically require more maintenance than a hybrid bike. The thin tyres are much more likely to get punctured and therefore, it’s probably best if you know how to quickly change an inner tube to avoid unexpected delays – the “sorry I’m late, my bike had a puncher excuse”, is a common one here in Cambridge and certainly not an attribute of the best Cambridge bicycle.

<h2>THE ELECTRIC, FOLDABLE, AND TANDEM BIKE</h2>
If you fancy soaring past others without having to put much effort in, why not get an electric bike? Alternatively, if you are travelling into the city by train or have little space for storing a bike, a clever foldable bike might be just for you. And if you’re struggling to think of a Valentine’s or birthday present for your partner, what could be more romantic and fun than a tandem bike!
