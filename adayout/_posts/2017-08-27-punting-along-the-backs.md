title: PUNTING ALONG THE BACKS OF THE RIVER CAM
---

Punting along The Backs is one of the most iconic things to do in Cambridge and is a fantastic day out with friends and family, or makes for a very special date. To see truly unmissable views of Cambridge University’s old colleges as well as the famous bridges, you should choose to go punting along The Backs rather than towards Grantchester. You can either hire a boat yourself and try your hand at punting. Alternatively, you can take a chauffeured tour along The Backs run by companies like Scudamores, where a professional will do the hard work for you and share stories about the history of Cambridge University.

A round trip punting along The Backs takes about an hour and is the perfect opportunity to enjoy a glass of prosecco and some strawberries in the sun while soaking up the stunning view of the colleges. Located close to the river, Cambridge Wine Merchants on King’s Parade serves a variety of alcoholic drinks from its window during the summer, such as Pimms and G&Ts, making it a perfect stop before hiring a punt. However, if you’re planning to visit Cambridge in the winter, don’t worry as punt tours continue throughout most of the year with companies supplying cosy blankets and umbrellas, and tourists switching a glass of Pimms for a warm, comforting hot chocolate. If you’re looking for a cup of something hot to take onboard, the famous Fitzbillies on Trumpington Street offers delicious teas, coffees, hot chocolates (and yummy cakes!) to take away.

Be sure to have your camera or phone ready as the views along the The Backs are gorgeous and you’ll definitely want to document your trip. From the river you’ll get to see the incredible scenes of Queen’s College, Mathematical Bridge, Clare College, Trinity College, The Wren Library, King’s College, King’s College Chapel, the Bridge of Sighs, St John’s College, and Magdalene College. If you come to Cambridge in early June, you’ll probably also spot many happy students enjoying a lazy afternoon of punting along The Backs, as exams and lectures will have finished for the year.

If you’re a Cambridge University student, punting along The Backs is a great chance to show your parents the beautiful old colleges when they come to visit. Some colleges have their own punts for students to hire and many organise discounted punting for students. If you are planning a special celebration in Cambridge, there are a variety of different punting packages offered, such as for hen parties, proposals, and weddings, as well as special ghost and bat safari tours.

During Cambridge University’s May Week when many of the colleges hold black tie balls for students, you can book places on punts to watch the amazing firework displays put on by St John’s College, Trinity College, and Clare College, from the river. With these firework displays renowned for being some of the best around, snuggling up to watch from the river makes for a romantic evening. Places are highly sort after so make sure you book early or alternatively if you want a sneak peak into what a Cambridge May Ball includes, you can see preparations in full swing from the river during the day.
