Planning a trip to Cambridge? With so many things to see and do in the city, it can be difficult to decide where to visit. To help, I’m going to be sharing some of my favourite places to visit in Cambridge. Here is how you can spend an afternoon exploring some of Cambridge University’s beautiful old colleges, St John’s College and Clare College.

<h2>ADMIRING THE IMPRESSIVE BUILDINGS OF ST JOHN’S COLLEGE</h2>
Walk along St John’s Street and you will come across the entrance to one of the wealthiest colleges in Cambridge, St John’s College. As you wander through the impressive main courts you can peek at the old-fashioned staircases housing academics’ offices and students’ rooms, or pay the beautiful chapel and the main dining hall a visit, where traditional Cambridge formal halls are held.

You’ll then find yourself at arguably one of the best spots in Cambridge for viewing the world-famous Bridge of Sighs (and for taking that all-important Instagram photo).

Across the river is St John’s Meadow; a fantastic spot for admiring the grand design of the college. The meadow is also where the magnificent firework display takes place for the annual May Ball, with many hiring punts to experience the magical atmosphere from the river.

Continue your stroll along Trinity Street towards Clare College, where you’ll likely catch a glimpse of a student cycling frantically to their lecture or dressed in a gown walking to a formal.

<h2>RELAXING IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS OF CLARE COLLEGE</h2>
Clare College has some of the prettiest gardens in Cambridge. Make sure to look at the intricate architecture of the college buildings as you head through the main court to the magnificent riverside gardens.

The Scholars’ Garden features quaint wooden benches on a lawn of pristinely cut grass.

On your way over Clare College Bridge, look across the river at postcard scenes of Cambridge.

The Fellows’ Garden is situated just across the bridge and provides the perfect place to relax beside the river. Here you can soak up the afternoon sun while admiring the skills of the punters as they pass by – and in case you’re wondering, punting is much harder than the professionals make it look!

Once you’ve finished taking in the breathtaking views of the colleges and the River Cam, head along Senate House Passage towards King’s Parade. If it’s a hot sunny day, why not pick up a refreshing juice from the market and continue exploring the city? The apple and ginger juice is delicious, and they even offer watermelon! But if you fancy a coffee or ice cream instead, pop to Benets Cafe near the corner of King’s Parade, where you can sit and watch the hustle and bustle of life in the city centre.
