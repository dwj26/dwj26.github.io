title: An Autumn Walk in Milton Country Park
---

While Cambridge is an exciting place to live and work, some weekends it is nice to escape the busy city and head to the countryside. Luckily, just a short cycle or drive away from the city centre is Milton Country Park. Despite being on the doorstep of Cambridge, Milton Country Park makes you feel as if you’re in the heart of the Cambridgeshire countryside. The park is a quiet and picturesque spot for a walk with friends or family and is the ideal place for a weekend run. (Milton Country Park hosts Parkrun and Junior Parkrun every Saturday, so if you are a keen runner or just fancy joining in, make sure to go along!)

The park has several beautiful lakes surrounded by woodland and patches of open green space. The maze of paths, boardwalks, and bridges allows you to explore the depths of the park (and almost get lost admiring its beauty!) The park is particularly stunning this time of year, scattered with crisp fallen leaves and the glow of the low autumn sun peaking through the trees.

There are plenty of benches dotted around that are perfect for indulging in a good book or soaking up the views over the lakes. The park is home to lots of wildlife too so you might find yourself making friends with some of the adorable locals!

After a long stroll, the park’s own cafe, Grounds, serves some delicious goodies and hot drinks. With an outside seating area overlooking one of the main lakes in the park, you can warm up with a cup of tea and a toffee apple muffin (so yummy!). These cute bunny mittens are from one of my favourite shops in Cambridge, Lilac Rose, and are perfect for keeping your hands toasty on a weekend walk.

I can’t recommend visiting Milton Country Park enough if you fancy a weekend walk or want a bit of peace and calm from life in the city. Why not pack your wellies in the car this autumn and head over?
