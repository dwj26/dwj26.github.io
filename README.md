A quick way to install Jekyll using Chocolatey is to follow the installation instructions by David Burela:

Install a package manager for Windows called Chocolatey
Install Ruby via Chocolatey: choco install ruby -y

You must also install the Ruby DevKit along with Ruby.:
https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
install the DevKit in c:/DevKit
then open command prompt and navigate to c:/Devkit
cd C:\DevKit
ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
devkitvars.bat

Reopen a command prompt and install Jekyll: gem install jekyll
Updates in the infrastructure of Ruby may cause SSL errors when attempting to use gem install with versions of the RubyGems package older than 2.6. (The RubyGems package installed via the Chocolatey tool is version 2.3) If you have installed an older version, you can update the RubyGems package using the directions here.
