A hot pot of tea with a delicious brunch is perfect on a cold and frosty November morning before hitting the shops to start your Christmas shopping. If it isn’t already, make sure a trip to The Old Bicycle Shop in Cambridge is on your brunch bucket list this winter.

There perhaps couldn’t be anything more quintessentially Cambridge than brunching in what was thought to be the oldest bicycle shop in the country. The Old Bicycle Shop is located on Regent’s Street and is filled with bicycle-inspired decorations; cycling photos, bike-themed artwork, oh and the odd saddle or two hanging from the walls. But The Old Bicycle Shop offers so much more than a stylish restaurant and bar where you can catch up with friends; their food is delicious and clearly most Cambridge locals agree as it can be tricky to get a table for brunch on a Saturday morning without a reservation!

Offering everything from the more traditional eggs benedict, granola with yoghurt, blueberry compote and dark chocolate clusters, to maple-smoked bacon sandwiches, there is something for everyone. If you fancy kick starting your day with something a bit sweeter than poached eggs and avocado, I’d opt for their mouth-watering sweet potato pancakes. You might think that using sweet potato to make pancakes sounds a bit odd (unless you’re the type to make the likes of chocolate avocado cakes) but don’t be sceptical as The Old Bicycle Shop’s pancakes are delicious. Topped with yoghurt, coconut, and honeyed figs, their pancake dish is absolutely scrummy. The flavours complement each other beautifully and while quite rich, the portion size leaves you feeling satisfied without the sweetness of the honey being overbearing. Washed down with a pot of their English breakfast tea from local supplier, Kandula Tea, and you have a winning brunch combination.

If you are starting your Christmas shopping over the coming weeks, why not treat yourself to a warming brunch at The Old Bicycle Shop – just the fuel you need before heading to the shops!
