Tucked away on the outskirts of the city centre is Mill Road – a road bursting with great independent shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes. It’s no surprise that the cute houses in the surrounding area are so sought-after. If you’re a foodie who loves trying new places, Mill Road will definitely be up your street.

As I blogged about [before](/mill-road-hidden-gems), Mill Road has a lovely cake shop (Tom’s Cakes), a fantastic delicatessen (Culinaris) and an exquisite North African restaurant (La Bedouin). But, there are lots of other great places to discover in the foodie paradise that is Mill Road! In this blog, I’m going to share some of the other hidden gems Mill Road has to offer - this time, venturing over the other side of the railway bridge.

## 196 Mill Road 

Did someone say cocktails? 196 is an independent (and arguably the best) cocktail bar in Cambridge. The extensive menu is written in beautiful curly writing on crinkled, tea-stained paper that just adds to the uniqueness of this cocktail bar. The talented baristas can whip up some delicious takes on the classics, such as a raspberry mojito, but also offer a variety of house specialities. You can tell that the ingredients are carefully selected and mixed to produce cocktails with the perfect balance of flavours. And with the drinks being fairly reasonably priced (around £8-£10), it’s no surprise that this bar is so popular and often raved about by locals. In the day, the exterior looks rather unassuming but from 5pm when the doors open, the bar is bursting with conversation and laughter. Once you’ve sampled the cocktails at 196, I’m sure you’ll be back for more!

## Black Cat Cafe

Black Cat Cafe was one of the first places I tried on Mill Road for brunch and it still remains one of the best. The cafe has a large breakfast/brunch menu offering everything from the traditional full English (the Black Cat breakfast) to avocado eggs benedict with their homemade lemon hollandaise - so yummy! Throw in one of their smoothies or some freshly squeezed orange juice and your weekend brunch fix is sorted and all for a reasonable price. Sit back on a Saturday and read the newspaper or use the free Wifi at Black Cat Cafe while watching life go by on Mill Road.

## Urban Larder

Since visiting Urban Larder for the first time earlier this year, it has quickly become one of my favourite cafes along Mill Road. Urban Larder can often be found to have a chilled working vibe as students and professionals flock to use the free Wifi while enjoying the coffee and cakes on offer. But the relaxed atmosphere also makes it a great place to meet friends for lunch or catch-up over a cup of tea. The lunch options are one of the highlights of Urban Larder - the likes of homemade salad bowls and scotch eggs, including leek and bacon or chorizo flavour. I personally love their toasties, which are made with fresh sourdough bread and the finest ingredients, such as caramelised roasted veg and mozzarella. With the recent launch of Urban Later, if you miss your fix of Urban Larder during the day, you can now pop in on certain evenings thanks to the cafe’s extended opening hours. Toasties for dinner sounds like a good idea to me!
