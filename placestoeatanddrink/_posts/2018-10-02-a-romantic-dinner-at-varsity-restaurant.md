A ROMANTIC DINNER AT VARSITY RESTAURANT
Whether you’re in a long-term relationship or just getting to know someone, going on a date is always exciting! While there are many things to decide on, such as which outfit to wear and how to style your hair, you also have to choose a restaurant. Fortunately, Cambridge has lots of romantic places for dinner but the Varsity Restaurant is one of my new favourites.

Varsity Restaurant is a quaint little bistro located in a beautiful townhouse on Regent’s Street. Despite being easily missed when in a hurry walking to work or running errands, Varsity’s exquisite food will leave you wishing you’d booked a table sooner.

The restaurant is split over two floors with just a handful of tables on each, creating a cosy atmosphere for a special evening out. The small number of tables still gives Varsity a nice lively atmosphere but one that isn’t too loud so you can easily chat to your partner over dinner.

The Varsity Restaurant’s menu features a range of mouth-watering dishes and flavour combinations that are as tasty as they sound! Perfectly cooked scallops with pancetta and wasabi, rich truffle-infused chips, and succulent roast duck breast with potato pancake, chargrilled leeks, and a ginger and plum purée – just a select of the options on their á la carte menu. The desserts are also delicious so make sure you save room; I’d recommend trying their banana and toffee cheesecake or eton mess.

The service at the Varsity Restaurant is second-to-none with the waiters and waitresses being incredibly friendly and helpful. Clearly Varsity has got its food, service, and atmosphere spot on as just earlier this year a sister restaurant called Trinity was opened on Trinity Street.

Once you’ve finished dinner, Varsity is just a few steps away from some of the great bars that line Regent’s Street, such as Old Bicycle Shop and Novi – the perfect way to continue your romantic evening together.

If you haven’t been to the Varsity Restaurant before, I’d definitely recommend going for your next date night.
