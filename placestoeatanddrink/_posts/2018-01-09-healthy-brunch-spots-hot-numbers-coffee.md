It’s a new year and for most of us that means trying to eat healthier and getting into a good exercise routine (at least that’s what we told ourselves when we set our New Year’s Resolutions!) Luckily for the brunch lovers out there, Cambridge has some great healthy brunch offerings. In this mini blog series, I’m going to be sharing a few of my favourites, which I’d encourage you to try this January. First up, Hot Numbers Coffee.

In the heart of Cambridge’s independent food scene is Hot Numbers Coffee, located on Gwydir Street. It’s a popular spot for sleepy locals to get their morning caffeine fix and serves a range of healthy, alternative brunch dishes. If you’ve had one too many eggs benedicts or avos on toast recently, their twists on classic brunch dishes will have your taste buds tingling again in no time. Take their Bacon Kimchi Benedict, served on sweet cornbread. It includes a helping of traditional, tangy Korean kimchi that perfectly complements the saltiness of the bacon and cooked-to-perfection poached eggs. Washed down with one of their famously good coffees and you’ll have found a new favourite (and healthy) brunch spot!
