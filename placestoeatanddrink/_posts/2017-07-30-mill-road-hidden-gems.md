Tucked away on the outskirts of the city centre is Mill Road – a road bursting with great independent shops, restaurants, pubs, and cafes. It’s no surprise that the cute houses in the surrounding area are so sought after. If you’re a foodie who loves trying new places, Mill Road will definitely be up your street.

In this blog series, I’ll be sharing some of the gems that Mill Road has to offer.

<h2>TOM’S CAKES</h2>
The perfect spot for a coffee and a slice of cake on a Saturday afternoon, Tom’s Cakes serves delicious homemade goodies. Cakes, brownies, tarts, shortbread, scones, and even jammie dodgers line the counter of this independent coffee shop. It’s a great place for a weekend catch-up or a much-needed sugar fix.

All of their baked treats can be taken away – perfect if you are heading to a friend’s house for a cup of tea or for a birthday celebration. If you’re an early bird, Tom’s Cakes also offers yummy breakfast options, such as homemade granola with berry compote and Greek yoghurt, and a variety of tasty savoury bites for lunch.

<h2>CULINARIS – FINE FOOD AND SPICES OF MILL ROAD</h2>
Culinaris is the definition of a foodie’s treasure trove. Step inside to enter a shop filled with speciality foods and ingredients. It offers everything from fine cheeses and meats, chutneys, sauces and pickles, to spices and beautifully wrapped chocolate. It’s the ideal place to fill a picnic basket or to source delicious supplies for a dinner party with friends.

<h2>BEDOUIN</h2>
If you are looking for something a bit different, why not head to Bedouin. A cosy restaurant located not far from Parker’s Piece, Bedouin serves mouth-watering North African cuisine. The colourful interior is complete with fabric draped from the ceiling, vibrant soft furnishings, and ornate lighting creating a romantic setting for dinner. The combination of flavours and spices is exquisite – it’s no wonder that this restaurant is so popular. I’d definitely recommend trying their Borek Jubna to start and either their Tagine Kefte Bedaoui or Felous M’Asella for main.
