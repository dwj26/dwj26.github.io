<h2>SIPPING TEA IN THE GORGEOUS GARDEN ROOM</h2>
The Tamburlaine’s Garden Room, where afternoon tea is served, is a gorgeous setting for celebrating a special occasion or for a much-needed girlie catch-up. The exquisite mix of dusty pinks, tropical greens, and natural white furnishings along with a scattering of indoor plants, gives this room an exotic feel. And the cute pink china with gold trim is to die for!

<h2>CATCHING UP OVER DELICIOUS PATISSERIES</h2>
The Tamburlaine offers a choice of three different afternoon teas: a simple cream tea; a traditional afternoon tea, complete with finger sandwiches and cakes; and a sparkling afternoon tea, if you fancy a glass of bubbles. The dainty finger sandwiches come with a variety of fillings, such as ham and mustard, smoked salmon, and of course the traditional cucumber filling. The fine leaf teas, including Second Flush Muscatel Darjeeling, Jasmine Silver Tip, and Lemon Verbena are served in stylish glass teapots – and go down a treat with the homemade scones and little patisseries.
