If your New Year’s Resolution is to switch your car for a bike or take up cycling for exercise, then Espresso Library is the brunch spot for you! A cafe with a culture centred around the cycling enthusiast, Espresso Library lets visitors hang their bikes on the wall, whilst sipping on one of their speciality coffees. Espresso Library opens at 7am on Saturdays and 8am on Sundays – ideal for stopping by for brunch after an early morning ride or on your cycle into town. If you fancy popping along for brunch, I’d recommend trying their avocado toast. Creamy smashed avocado served on sourdough bread, Espresso Library’s classic – and healthy – brunch dish is a winner. And with the option to add a variety of toppings, such as smoked chickpeas, prosciutto, or poached eggs, you can customise the dish how you’d like. What better way to refuel after a morning bike ride?
