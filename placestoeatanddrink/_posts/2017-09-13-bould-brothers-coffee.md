On a crisp autumnal morning, there is nothing like a warming cup of tea or coffee to start your day. Great independent coffee shops are not rare in Cambridge but if you’re wandering around the shops on Bridge Street or exploring some of Cambridge’s beautiful old colleges, I’d recommend stopping at Bould Brothers Coffee.

Bould Brothers Coffee, Bridge Street, Cambridge



Bould Brothers Coffee is an independent coffee shop located in a quintessential townhouse that offers a relaxing setting for a comforting drink or to finish writing an essay. With tables on the first floor, you can sip on a latte whilst looking out over the beautiful buildings of The Round Church and The Cambridge Union. The cafe has just a scattering of tables making it one of the quieter spots in Cambridge for collecting your thoughts or pondering the day ahead.

Inside Bould Brothers Coffee

If you’d rather sit outside and soak up the atmosphere of the city centre, the cafe has a little bench at the front with blankets for those chillier days – perfect for wrapping up on a cold winter’s morning with a hot chocolate. Located not far from the river, Bould Brothers Coffee is also the ideal place for rowers to grab a warm cappuccino and croissant on the way back from early morning training before heading to lectures.

Bould Brothers Coffee, which prides itself on its speciality coffee, does not disappoint. The coffee is delicious and is perfectly complemented with one of the cafe’s tasty baked treats – their blondie brownie with berries and apricot crumble cake are my favourites!
