Pancake Day is just around the corner – the day where it is perfectly acceptable to have pancakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! But where’s best to go for pancakes in Cambridge to get your fix of flipping goodness? With toppings ranging from indulgent Nutella and strawberries, poached pears with raspberries and mascapone, to chia pancakes, as you can imagine, the Cambridge food scene does not disappoint when it comes to pancakes.

Here are my suggested places to go for pancakes in Cambridge this Pancake Day:

<h2>HOT NUMBERS COFFEE</h2>
Some of the most delicious pancakes I’ve tried in Cambridge recently are the buttermilk pancakes at <a href="hotnumbers.co.uk">Hot Numbers Coffee</a>. Their fluffy pancakes are served with soft, cinnannon-spiced poached pears and juicy raspberries, and topped with a dollop of mascapone and tiny basil shoots.

<h2>CRÊPE AFFAIRE</h2>
<a href="www.crepeaffaire.com">Crêpe Affaire</a> has one of the largest ranges of pancake toppings in Cambridge and you can even add extra items to create your ultimate pancake combination. Offering both savoury and sweet pancake toppings, including goats cheese with onion confit and spinach and apple with butterscotch sauce and crumble. At Crêpe Affaire you can watch your beautifully golden and thin pancake being made right in front of you too!

<h2>OLD BICYCLE SHOP</h2>
When it comes to alternative pancake mixtures, I’d recommend <a href="www.oldbicycleshop.com">Old Bicycle Shop’s</a> mouth-watering sweet potato pancakes, as I’ve <a href="/brunch-old-bicycle-shop">blogged about before</a>. While you might think that using sweet potato to make pancakes sounds a bit odd (unless you’re the type to make the likes of chocolate avocado cakes), don’t be sceptical as Old Bicycle Shop’s pancakes are delicious. Topped with yoghurt, coconut, and honeyed figs (or other yummy seasonal combinations, such as winter-spiced pear with Greek yoghurt and oat crumble), the flavours complement each other beautifully and while quite rich, the portion size will leave you feeling happily satisfied.

<h2>NOVI</h2>
For something a bit different this Pancake Day, I’d head to <a href = "https://novicambridge.co.uk">Novi</a> to try their chia and coconut flour pancakes. These doughy pancakes are served with fresh berries and a naughty (but scrummy) maple cream to drizzle over.

<h2>CAMBRIDGE CREPES</h2>
Despite living in Cambridge for a number of years, I still haven’t sampled the famous pancakes from <a href="www.cambridgecrepes.co.uk">Cambridge Crepes</a> – a food van that comes to the centre of the city (opposite Next) most days of the week. However, Cambridge Crepes is definitely on my list of places to try this Pancake Day! Enjoying a freshly cooked crepe with oodles of Nutella while sitting in the sunshine outside King’s College sounds like a pretty great afternoon to me!

<h2>PANCAKE INSPIRATION TO TRY AT HOME</h2>
If you fancy some pancake flipping at home, here are some pancake toppings to try:

<ul class="posts">
<li>Nutella with raspberries and strawberries</li>
<li>Maple syrup with streaky bacon </li>
<li>Peanut butter and banana</li>
<li>Baked apple with toffee sauce </li>
</ul>

<h2>SCOTCH PANCAKES WITH GREEK YOGHURT, BERRIES, AND FLAKED ALMONDS</h2>
Don’t have time to make pancakes from scratch? Scotch pancakes (available from most local supermarkets) can make for an easy and tasty alternative on Pancake Day. Simply toast each pancake for about 3–5 minutes until slightly crisp on the outside and then top with spoonfuls of plain greek yoghurt, followed by a generous helping of raspberries and blueberries (if you’d prefer more of a berry dressing, gently soften the fruit on a low heat). For the finishing touch, sprinkle with some flaked almonds and, voila, yummy pancakes made in minutes!
