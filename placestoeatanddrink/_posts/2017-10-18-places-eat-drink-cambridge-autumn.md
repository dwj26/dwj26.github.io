Cambridge looks magnificent at this time of year with autumnal shades of brown, red, orange, and yellow perfectly complementing the beautiful university buildings. It’s a great time of year to explore the city and take in the gorgeous colours – as a visitor or as a local. As the temperature drops and the breeze picks up, warm drinks and comforting food is just what is needed. Here are my top places to eat and drink in Cambridge this Autumn.

<h2>COFFEE – BOULD BROTHERS COFFEE</h2>
As I blogged about before, Bould Brothers Coffee serves some of the best coffee in Cambridge. The cute wooden benches outside (complete with cosy blankets) are the ideal place to warm up with a creamy flat white on a crisp autumnal morning, while watching the city come to life.

<h2>LUNCH – THE SENATE BISTRO</h2>
The Senate Bistro just off King’s Parade offers yummy bites for lunch and is ideally located for a quick pit stop before continuing your tour of the city. Their cheese board comes with four different cheese varieties, thick slices of bread, a tasty chutney, and fruit. Who doesn’t love such a delicious combination?

<h2>COCKTAILS – D’ARRY’S LIQUOR LOFT</h2>
As apples, blackberries, and damsons come into season, it’s time to switch the peach bellinis and cosmopolitans for more autumnal drinks, such as sloe gin and hot mulled cider. If you are looking for a cosy bar to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail after a busy day of shopping, head to d’Arry’s Liquor Loft – their Bramble cocktails are scrummy!

<h2>DINNER – SALT PIG</h2>
In case you haven’t heard, there is a new Mediterranean restaurant in town called Salt Pig. Open all day serving everything from breakfast and brunch to afternoon tea and dinner, make sure to pay the restaurant a visit this autumn. I’d recommend their truffled goats’ cheese on sourdough toast with flaked almonds and honey as a starter.
