Winter is the season for comfort food, cosy knits, and hot chocolates. Luckily, the Cambridge food and drink scene serves up some delicious hot chocolates to keep us all warm and toasty while dashing around in the cold Christmas shopping. After sampling many hot chocolates around Cambridge this winter, here is my Cambridge hot chocolate guide featuring some of the best on offer.

<h2>Hotel Chocolat</h2>
Need some energy for a busy day Christmas shopping in the Grand Arcade? Luckily Hotel Chocolat is right on your doorstep. While the shop contains an extensive range of tasty festive treats, the cafe serves one of the largest ranges of hot chocolates in Cambridge! The luxury chocolate retail chain offers everything from 70% and 100% dark hot chocolates, to flavoured hot chocolates, including salted caramel and chilli, as well as festive varieties, such as winter spice. Made from flakes of pure chocolate stirred into milk and topped with a chocolate-flavoured cream, it’s definitely worth stopping by Hotel Chocolat to try one.

<h2>Chocolat Chocolat</h2>

For the ultimate naughty treat this winter, Chocolat Chocolat offers little pots of thick, melted chocolate yumminess – you’ll definitely need the spoon they provide with it! As specialist chocolatiers, their hot chocolate is made from rich, smooth chocolate and can be topped with a range of seasonal goodies, such as marshmallows, honeycomb, cream, and chocolate stars. Make sure you check out their gorgeous range of chocolate gifts while you’re there!

<h2>Aromi</h2>

If you fancy a taste of Sicily, head to Aromi for one of their special hot chocolates. Available in three divine flavours; hazelnut, dark cocoa, or pistachio, their thick, rich hot chocolates will help you warm up from the cold in no time – whether you’re Christmas shopping in the Grafton Centre or strolling along King’s Parade.

<h2>Jack’s Gelato</h2>

Jack’s Gelato has a new addition to the menu and it’s something a bit different from their much loved gelato. If you find most hot chocolates too sweet and quite difficult to finish, you’ll be pleased to know that Jack’s Gelato now serves a delicious, unsweetened hot chocolate – a rare breed in the world of chocolat chauds! A rich, slightly bitter dark chocolate flavour and a light consistency, their hot chocolate is very easy to drink. With the parlour open until 10pm most days, Jack’s Gelato is the perfect place to drop by for dessert or to help you through a long evening in the library.

<h2>Stir</h2>

Stir brings a buzz of energy to the end of Chesterton Road. It’s rare to find this coffee shop empty and with a delicious hot chocolate, you can see why! Perhaps the master of hot chocolate art (if that’s even a thing) and the ideal place to meet up with the family, make sure you head to Stir this winter to sample their hot chocolate.

<h2>Fitzbillies</h2>

How could the iconic Fitzbillies not be included in a Cambridge hot chocolate guide? A delicious drink from one of Cambridge’s most famous coffee shops, Fitzbillies’ hot chocolate is made with mouth-watering ganache from their bakery. Mixed into warm milk, their hot chocolate will keep you warm whether you are visiting Cambridge University’s beautiful colleges or punting along the River Cam.

<h2>Benets</h2>
If wrapping up warm and sipping on a hot chocolate outside in the crisp winter air is your kind of thing, Benets is the place for you. Serving yummy hot chocolates topped with all the trimmings, this family-run cafe is located in one of the best spots in Cambridge overlooking King’s College Chapel and Senate House; perfect for watching the morning sun melt away the frost, or to admire the twinkly Christmas lights.

If I had to pick my favourites, they would be the delicious, unsweetened hot chocolate offered by Jack’s Gelato and Chocolat Chocolat’s pot of thick, rich melted chocolate – the perfect winter treats!
